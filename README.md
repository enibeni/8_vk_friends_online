# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. 
Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv]
(https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.
